	<h2>"Entertainment को  entertainment की तरह देख।. You don't have to learn from everything"</h2>

    <p>
        I love to consume content. Be it reading books, watching movies or TV shows; I even like watching ads! And I like to analyse and learn from everything that I consume. 
        I learn about power dynamics and social manipulation from Game of Thrones. I like to pause Big Bang Theory to analyse and judge whether the formulae written on the whiteboards make sense.
        I analyse my own response to advertisements and try to correlate them with the length of the ad, music used, visual effects, acting, cinematography and whatnot.
    </p>
    <p>
        My friends usually join me in the analysis and further the discussion. 
        But every once in a while, I come across someone new who has a problem with this. And they say that we "should not take entertainment seriously and only consume it as 'entertainment'".
    </p>
    <p>
        First question: What does "consume it as 'entertainment'" even mean? For that, we need to know what the word 'entertainment' means.
        Since it is a dictionary word, I just looked it up. 
        <blockquote>Entertainment: the action of providing or being provided with amusement or enjoyment</blockquote>
        Okay, but what do these terms mean?
        <blockquote>Amusement: the state or experience of finding something funny</blockquote>
        <blockquote>Enjoyment: the state or process of taking pleasure in something</blockquote>
        Okay, so "consume it as 'entertainment'" means laugh at it and/or find pleasure in it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's think about what 'pleasure' means. But if you look up 'pleasure', you will circle back to the word 'enjoyment'. 
        So we will have to look for a different way to define it. 
        Let's introspect, shall we? 
        When I think about pleasure, I think of moments when I felt excited or when I was happy; and when is that?
        It happens every time I win something. It happens when I am playing football or running a 5K. Every time I am with my loved ones having a good time. Every time my mentees do or achieve something that makes me feel proud.
        I think you can see where this is going...
    </p>
    <p>
        If you distil these moments: winning, workout, love, pride; these are directly related to our pleasure hormones: dopamine, endorphin, oxytocin, serotonin. 
        So we can define entertainment as anything that releases pleasure chemicals in our minds.
        So we understand how sports, exercise, sex or even, weirdly, working can be associated with entertainment.
        But these are not relevant to the topic when we are talking about "consuming entertainment". 
    </p>
    <p>
        When we talk about consuming content, like watching a movie, how does it release these pleasure hormones in us?
        In my experience, it happens because I project myself onto one or more characters in the story that I am watching/reading about.
        Yes, even in non-fiction. When I am reading about science, for example, I am in the shoes of the experimenter or the scientist.
        Sometimes, I am even projecting myself on the test subjects! When the experiment is a social, psychological or philosophical one.
        And when we consume the content, we live through the experiences of whoever we are projecting ourselves on.
        So when they feel happy, we feel happy. When they feel sad, we feel sad. When they feel proud, so do we, and when they feel loved, so do we.
    </p>
    <p>
        So the way to be entertained is to experience a character we can project ourselves on going through something that releases pleasure hormones in us.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, the interesting thing about "experiencing" is that you only experience something by receiving signals through your sense organs and processing those signals in your brain to make sense of it.
        And our brain is a self-training <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network">neural network</a>.
        This means, every experience triggers a bunch of paths in our neural networks and modifies the weights on them.
        If our experience is very different from our expectation (meaning that our inference error was high), then the weight adjustments are bigger, otherwise, they can be small. 
        Sometimes, maybe they just reinforce our existing inference if we experience exactly what we expected.
    </p>
    <p>
        But in any case, the weight adjustments <em>are</em> happening every time we experience something. 
        Whether through our interactions with the surroundings, through a proxy (like a character in a movie or a book), or even in our dreams.
        So, it is impossible to experience anything without learning.
    </p>
    <p>
    And if consuming entertainment entails experiencing something, and if experiencing implies learning, then I conclude that <b>it is impossible to consume content as <em>entertainment</em> without learning.</b>

        When I had this discussion with my friend and colleague, Muskan, we went even deeper, arguing whether it is even possible to not be learning while not being dead!
    </p>
    <p>
        Our best guess comes from the last piece of common content we consumed. It is a documentary called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzH6BI6P4Uo&ab_channel=Netflix">The Deepest Breath</a> (which, by the way, I would recommend that you also watch).
        The divers there need to hold their breaths for upwards of 4 minutes, which depletes their brains of enough oxygen to properly function.
        They fall unconscious and their brains focus whatever resources it has left on running bodily functions.
        Although, it can't carry that on for much longer if it doesn't get supplied with oxygen soon.
        This state is called a 'blackout'. 
        And we believe, that in a blackout, a person might not be dead, and yet, not be learning anything.
    </p>
    <p>
        And it goes without saying, their brains would be doing a hell of a lot of thinking and learning as soon as they gain consciousness; surviving a near-death experience.
