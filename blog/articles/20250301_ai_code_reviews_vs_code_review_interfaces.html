	<h2>The AI Code Review Disconnect: Why Your Tools Aren't Solving Your Real Problem</h2>
	<small id="publishDate"><!-- Autofilled from meta --></small>
	<p>Many engineering teams are purchasing AI code review tools, but are they solving the problem they think they are?
	</p>

	<h3>The Bottleneck Reality</h3>
	<p>Over the past few months, I've had eye-opening conversations with dozens of engineers from Series-B and Series-C
		startups. As the founder of Vibinex, I'm naturally curious about their code review processes, especially when
		they mention it's a pain point.</p>
	<p>A common pattern emerges: their most valuable engineers are spending significant time reviewing pull requests, or
		worse, fixing issues in previously shipped features, instead of building new features. This bottleneck slows
		down the entire development cycle, leading to product delays and frustration across teams.</p>

		start((("`**Author Raises pull request**`"))) --> ci["`CI/CD/CT`"]
		ci --> r1["Author makes fixes for automated feedback & requests human review"]
		r1 --> r2{"Reviewer reads issue description, reads code changes line-by-line, identifies bugs/issues & tests locally and provides feedback"}
		r2 --> |Requests changes|f1["Author makes fixes"]
		r2 --> |Approves|last((("`**PR merged**`")))
		f1 --> r2
	</pre>
	<center style="margin-top: -20px;"><strong>Tradition PR review flow</strong></center>
	<p>To address this challenge, many have turned to AI-powered code review tools like <a
			href="https://coderabbit.ai">CodeRabbit</a>, <a href="https://codeant.ai">CodeAnt</a>, <a
			href="https://greptile.com">Greptile</a>, or <a href="https://www.ellipsis.dev/">Ellipsis</a>, hoping to
		accelerate their review process.</p>

	<h3>The AI Tool Adoption Paradox</h3>
	<p>When I ask these teams how they evaluated these tools before purchase, they invariably mention the quality of PR
		comments – bug detection, security vulnerabilities, style recommendations, and readability improvements. These
		are all valuable capabilities focused on code quality.</p>
	<p>But here's where it gets interesting: when I ask them to walk me through their actual review steps with these
		tools in place, a different picture emerges.</p>
	<q>Well, I get a Slack notification with the PR link, open the PR, look at the AI comments, but then I still
		need to go through the code myself to understand the changes and their implications.</q>
	<p>They're still performing every step they did before adopting these tools.</p>

	<h3>The Misalignment</h3>
	<p>This reveals a fundamental misalignment between expectations and reality. Teams purchase these tools hoping to
		reduce the time senior engineers spend on reviews, but they're actually getting tools that primarily help
		authors write better code.</p>
	<p>Don't get me wrong – improving code quality before review is tremendously valuable. Catching bugs, formatting
		issues, and potential performance problems early saves time for everyone.</p>
	<p>But if your primary goal is to reduce the review bottleneck, there's a disconnect between the problem you're
		trying to solve and the solution you've implemented.</p>

	<h3>Author Tools vs. Reviewer Tools</h3>
	<p>This insight helped me realize an important distinction: most AI code review tools on the market today are
		fundamentally author-focused, not reviewer-focused.</p>
	<p>They excel at:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Catching issues before human review begins</li>
		<li>Suggesting improvements to code quality</li>
		<li>Providing educational feedback to developers</li>
		<li>Enforcing style guidelines and best practices</li>
	</ul>
	<p>But they don't fundamentally change how reviewers experience the review process. Reviewers still need to read the
		code changes <i>line-by-line</i> to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Understand what the code is trying to accomplish</li>
		<li>Identify business logic issues that AI can't catch</li>
		<li>Assess architectural implications</li>
		<li>Evaluate how changes fit into the broader system</li>
	</ul>
	<p>When engineers tell me they've adopted AI code review tools to "save time on reviews," there's often confusion
		about which side of the equation they're optimizing for.</p>

	<h3>The Complementary Approach</h3>
	<p>I used to emphasize that Vibinex wasn't competing with these AI code review tools. But I've changed my
		perspective. We're all trying to solve the same problem – making the development cycle more efficient – just
		from different angles.</p>
	<p>Author-focused tools improve code before review, while reviewer-focused tools make the review experience itself
		more efficient. The ideal solution likely includes both approaches.</p>
	<p>Rather than viewing these as competing solutions, engineering teams should consider how they complement each
		other:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Author-focused tools ensure higher quality code enters the review process</li>
		<li>Reviewer-focused tools accelerate the human review that remains essential</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Looking Forward</h3>
	<p>As development teams face increasing pressure to ship faster while maintaining quality, examining the entire PR
		lifecycle becomes critical. The goal shouldn't be eliminating human review, but making it as efficient and
		valuable as possible.</p>
	<p>By understanding the distinct needs of authors and reviewers, teams can build a more holistic approach to code
		reviews that truly accelerates development cycles.</p>
	<p>The next time you evaluate tools in this space, consider which part of the problem you're truly trying to solve:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Are you looking to improve code quality before review?</li>
		<li>Are you trying to reduce the time your best engineers spend reviewing code?</li>
		<li>Or do you need both?</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Clarifying this distinction will help you make more informed decisions about which tools will actually deliver
		the outcomes you're seeking.</p>
