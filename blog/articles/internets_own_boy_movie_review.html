	<h2>The Internet's Own Boy and the importance of Self-Preservation</h2>
	<small id="publishDate">Date: 8th July 2021</small>
	<p>
		I watched a movie today, named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vz06QO3UkQ">The Internet's Own Boy: The
			Story of Aaron Swartz</a>, which is a biographical documentary directed by <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Knappenberger">Brian Knappenberger</a>.
		I watched it as an assignment for an open-source summer training program conducted by <a
			href="https://dgplug.org/">#dgplug</a>.
		I am 26 years old while I am writing this. And though I'm probably not even a 100th of <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz">Aaron Swartz</a> in terms of talent, impact or courage, I
		still saw him as a version of myself. And was deeply hurt when it was revealed that he died at the age of 26
		years.
	</p>
	<p>
		Although, like him, I had a computer in my house at the age of 5, but very unlike him, I only really learnt to
		program when I was 17 years old.
		Back in my childhood, the use of computer for me was mostly restricted to playing games, using the typing tutor
		program, drawing random stuff on MS Paint and making architectural drawings in 3D Home.
		We did learn HTML and BASIC in 5th grade, but then the computer teacher who taught all this got fired for some
		behavioural misconduct.
		And we were stuck with the new teacher who never taught us anything apart from the applications offered by
		Microsoft Office.
		For some reason, at that time, I believed that a lot cannot be done with just BASIC, and I need to learn QBASIC
		to really do amazing stuff, and I talked to the new teacher to teach me that. After a little back and forth,
		where she started learning what that is, and I started doubting whether she can teach me that, we both lost
		interest and I never really yielded the power of programming until much later.
	</p>
	<p>
		I must say, I am really moved by this movie. I had tears in my eyes by the end of the movie.
		And this is news for me because I generally don't feel deeply about people who die by suicide.
		For example, I was a fanboy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester_Bennington">Chester
			Bennington</a>, a singer of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linkin_Park">Linkin Park</a>, from my
		childhood.
		And I wasn't a fan of that amazing artist anymore after I learnt that he had killed himself.
		I have never been able to idealize people who give up their life in the selfish attempt to escape whatever
		temporary trouble they are facing.
		Unable to understand the repercussions of their actions - and how it empowers who did wrong to them and how it
		weakens and discredits everyone who stood by them through thick and thin.
		Unable to understand how to manage themselves, how to and who to reach out to when they need help.
		Unable to build a support system for themselves which can save them from suicidal thoughts and actions when they
		are swimming in the pool of shit that life is throwing at them at an alarming rate.
	</p>
	<p>
		As is common in my culture, I value the mastery of the self, everything that is inside, over the mastery of the
		world, everything that is outside. Believing that the latter cannot truly be attained in the lack of the former.
		And the same has been depicted in the story of this amazing genius.
		I know, what you are thinking: why does this article focus so much on suicide, ignoring every single amazing
		things that Aaron did and achieved in just 26 years of a lifetime? It is because I deeply mourn the death of
		such an amazing person.
		I would have sought his guidance and mentorship if he were still alive. I haven't achieved as much as he has,
		but I am good at learning. I haven't yet sold a million dollar company like Reddit, but in 8 years, I have gone
		from a nobody to a very sought after talent in the industry; To build something impactful indigenously.
		And I feel disappointed watching the end of a life that I would have liked to idealize.
	</p>
	<p>
		I am in awe of the kind of things he was able to do from a very young age. I don't believe in prodigies. I
		believe that he was that good because it is possible to be that good, if the right stimulus-action-reward loops
		are formed in a child's mind. Especially in programming, which is just another language.
		And as we all know <a
			href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334801340_Children_and_Adults_in_Second-Language_Learning">Children
			are better at learning languages than adults</a>.
		What really astonishes me is not his technical ability, but this psychological ones.
		He was able to deeply decipher the world and identify really deep-rooted problems to work on.
		He publicised deep thinking and meaningful living so effectively to such a large mass of people.
		And he was able to mobilize such large masses of people against all odds to help them stand by and reinforce the
		contract that they have all devoted themselves to by recognizing themselves as citizens of the USA.
	</p>
	<p>
		I am incredibly moved by his work against PACER tech. I have always been longing for doing such a thing for most
		sources of knowledge whenever I get access to any, but then I stop myself from doing that just because I do not
		have any idea of the laws around the same.
		And I am too much of a pussy to take the plunge and take the heat.
		But I do believe in the power of knowledge, just like Aaron did. And I am now motivated to take the plunge.
		I am motivated to carry on the legacy of the internet's own boy.

	<hr />
	<p>I am not taking any big legal or political risks here, but still trying to make a positive change in the
		political scenario in India with this open-source project, called <a
			href="https://github.com/avikalpg/IndianVotingAssistant">IndianVotingAssistant</a>, that aims at making it
		easy for the public to access the already public information when they vote, to select their representatives
		better.
		Please join and support the project in any way that you can.
