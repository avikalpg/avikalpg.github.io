	<h2>Cook your own meal.</h2>
	<p>
		In the Indian household, it is a norm that the woman in the house will do the cooking.
		Funnily, this does not necessarily mean that the man in the house will be earning the bread.
		It is not uncommon to see that the woman is earning the bread and cooking it while the man just wastes his
		entire day.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another observation is that in India, the wife often outlives the husband, sometimes by decades.
		Obviously, there are exceptions.
		And there is the XX chromosome advantage - most women live longer than men.
		Plus, the Indian practice of matchmaking the girl with an older man, even if the difference is just a few days.
		But I don't think these factors explain the decades that the woman lives without her husband.
		I want to argue that this difference is because of the difference in their lifestyles.
		Particularly related to food.
	</p>
	<p>
		My argument consists of three factors: quality of food, physical activity as a byproduct of cooking and
		psychological effects of cooking.
	</p>

	<h3>Quality of food</h3>
	<p>
		When you know how to cook, you can be in complete control of what you ingest.
		When you don't, you can frequently land in a situation where you have to rely on untrusted agents to provide you
		with food.
		Eating out, from vendors who might or might not be using the best quality ingredients in the healthiest
		portions, sometimes is fine.
		You might get lucky. Or you might just get food poisoning, which can be treated in less than a week with no
		long-term effects.
		But frequently eating out can lead to long-term damage to your health.
	</p>
	<p>
		Problems related to food habits are much more common in men than women in India, as a result.
		Women have better control over both, the quality and quantity of the food that they eat.
		As a result, heart problems (caused by high cholesterol), diabetes (related to blood sugar), high or low blood
		pressure (affected by salt intake) and obesity are rampant among Indian men.
		While these problems are not that common among women in India (especially until they become mothers-in-law to
		other Indian women :D).
	</p>

	<h3>Physical activity for cooking</h3>
	<p>
		It might not look like much, but regularly cooking your meals can give your body some critical physical
		activity.
	</p>
	<p>
		No, I am not comparing cooking to exercising.
		It would not pump your heart like a cardiovascular exercise or sports.
		But if you have observed modern health tracking applications, you would observe that "active time" is an
		important metric there.
		Cooking 2-3 times a day ensures that your body is active 2-3 times for around half an hour each day.
		Most kitchens are built such that you have to either stand or squat to be able to manage your cooktop
		effectively.
		Both these postures are low-intensity complex muscle group exercises.
	</p>
	<p>
		This might not sound like much, but that is how our body works.
		Working out 20 hours one day in a month every month will not work.
		Neither for building strength nor for losing weight.
		However, working out for one hour on 20 different days in a month can help you make significant progress towards
		your fitness goals.
		In the same way, these ~30 minutes of low-intensity body movements, repeated 2-3 times a day, almost every day
		throughout your life can add up to humongous outcomes.
	</p>

	<h3>Psychological effects of cooking</h3>
	<p>
		When you cook your own food, you are witnessing every ingredient that is used in its preparation.
		Your mind is more aware of everything that is going to go inside your body, as compared to eating food that is
		cooking in your absence.
		You might underestimate your subconscious brain in this, but even if you do not know what each ingredient does
		to your body, millennia of evolution have trained your brain to understand what will happen on eating which
		ingredient and how the body processes it.
	</p>
	<p>
		This benefit of cooking can actually also be seen in the short term.
		You might be attributing it to the slight changes in the proportions that you do to customise the food to
		yourself.
		Obviously, those changes do have their effects.
		But the fact is, no matter what changes you make, your body will feel healthier if you eat food that you cook
		yourself because it is able to process it better.
		In fact, the changes in the proportions - that often feel intuitive, are triggered in your brain because of this
		evolutionary intelligence of your subconscious brain.
	</p>

	<h3>Confession and next steps</h3>
	<p>
		I must confess, that as an Indian man, I too do not cook a lot of my meals.
		I tried doing that before my marriage. I learnt how to cook well.
		I even have a couple of dishes that are known among my loved ones with my name.
		But my wife's proficiency in cooking means that we will save time as a group if she handles the cooking.
		She takes half the amount of time to prepare any meal.
	</p>
	<p>
		But I offer to help.
		I do get the opportunity to cook when she is out of town. Or when, unfortunately, she falls sick.
		But even generally, I try to show up in the kitchen to offer help.
		I would chop some vegetables and wash some dishes every now and then.
	</p>
	<p>
		This way, even if I do not make the most contribution to the household in terms of meal preparation, I do get
		the benefits of cooking.
	<ol>
		<li>
			I have the capability and the interest to cook my meals.
			Which means that I do not rely on others for my food. If the situation arises, I will still control the
			quality and quantity of the food I intake.
		</li>
		<li>
			If I show up to the kitchen, even if I just chop some vegetables, I am getting that little bit of physical
			activity. Multiple times a day, every day.
		</li>
		<li>
			By just being around when the meal is being prepared, I can observe the ingredients in my food.
			My subconscious mind gets the input it needs to direct the digestive system to do its magic and keep me
			healthy.
		</li>
	</ol>
	On top of it, I make it a point to do some cardiovascular exercise at least 4 times a week.
	I don't enjoy going to the gym, but I love sports.
	I find time to run (5K, 10K, half-marathons), and I play Squash, Badminton or Futsal every once in a while.
	I ride a bicycle to work every day, even when I do have motor-based alternatives on 2 wheels and on 4 wheels.
	</p>
	<p>
		As a startup founder, I cannot afford to fall sick.
		When I go down, the morale of the whole team follows closely.
		And so does the output, especially when the team is so lean.
	</p>
	<p>
		Do you agree with my observations and my opinion?
		Or is there something that I have completely missed?
		I always preach that one should prioritize these things in life: Health &gt; Family &gt; Work.
		Since I value health the most, I would be extremely grateful to you if you could add, edit or improve anything
		about my mindset related to it.
