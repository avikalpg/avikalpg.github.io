			<p id="heading">OpenSource: Indian Voting Assistant <i>
					<font size=2>(date: 9 May 2021)</font>
				</i></p>
			<p id="body">
				I have started a free open-source project called <a
					href="https://github.com/avikalpg/IndianVotingAssistant">Indian Voting Assitant</a> on Github. The
				objective of this project is to make it easier for the Indian people to vote responsibly. Currently,
				voting responsibility is an extremely arduous endevour. Most people either cast their vote after getting
				influenced by other people around them, propaganda or media, or they skip voting altogether. Only a few
				privileged and sincere people are capable enough to perform the essential homework in order to know who
				to vote for. This project is aimed at providing self-submitted public information about the candidate to
				the voter in a format that is accessible and lucid for the end voter. For example, the resume (past
				education, achievements and positions), the criminal records, political party affiliations as well as
				the election manifesto of the candidate is the minimum amount of information that any voter should be
				aware of before voting for their representative. Whereas, a large majority of the voters don't even know
				the name of their representative before appearing for the election.</br>
				I appeal any Indian programmer looking at this, to go through the source code and provide their inputs
				for the same.

					<font size=2>(Feb'18-Sep'18)</font>
				</i></p>
			<p id="body">
				Looking into the work-flow of the deliveries of the drug Xyrem of Jazz Pharmaceuticals, we, at <a
					href="https://www.freshgravity.com/">Fresh Gravity</a>, proposed a markov-chain based decision
				support system because of the presence of the various states and differing probabilities of their
				transition. There are well-defined recurrent and transient states in their work-flow, which increased
				our confidence about the aptness of the markov-chain based model. We were able to build a model which
				could raise spikes whenever there were anomalies. Running it on past data, the model showed spikes
				related to every significant historical point with known anomaly, as well as pointed out to some which
				were not previously recognised.
				As a future step, we also explored the possibility of using more sophisticated algorithms for predicting
				and analysing order workflows and to get useful insights from them using XAI (Explanable Artificial
				Intelligence) algorithms like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938v3">LIME</a>.

					<font size=2>(Nov'17-Mar'18)</font>
				</i></p>
			<p id="body">
				Using the power of <a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch">Elastic Search</a>'s
				full-text search engine and the open-source code of the <a
					href="https://github.com/FerreroJeremy/ln2sql">LN2SQL</a>, we have created a stronger
				English-interface to most databases (most databases accept queries in Standard Query Language). We are
				able to achieve as high as 77% precision@10 scores on our predictions of the column and table name in
				the select clause on the <a href="https://github.com/salesforce/WikiSQL">WikiSQL</a> dataset.<br>
				We have exposed an JSON API end-point for this solution. Once the data is indexed in the Elastic Search
				engine of the server, any user can ask questions based on that database using just an HTTP request.
				There are on-going enhancements in the algorithm using word-net based synonym-sets. We are also planning
				to improve the sentence parsing using meaning representation parsing (this never happened).
