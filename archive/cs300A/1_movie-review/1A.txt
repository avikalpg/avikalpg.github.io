Movie Review- The Perks of being a Wallflower

Director : Stephen Chbosky

Cast: Lorgan Lerman (protagonist) as Charlie, Emma Watson as Sam, Ezra Miller as Patrick

My rating: 8/10

The movie, The Perks of being a Wallflower, was also a very renowned and famous 1999 novel and the movie is an adaptation of the same novel. 
The movie is about a 15-year old boy, named, Charlie (Logan Lerman), whose friend recently committed suicide. He is an introvert high school freshman who struggles to make friends at high school after the things he had gone through. So he maintains a diary as a substitute friend. He has special interest in Literature and Music. He is striving to find his own niche. Events take a turn when he meets Patrick (Ezra Miller) and his step-sister, Samantha (Emma Watson). The trio soon starts to share a perfect rapport, found out their common interests and the value of each other. The movie goes about picturizing the experiences of this trio and a group they were related to.

The movie is about the highs and lows of the teenage life. It is very emotional, didactic and catchy as well. 
The direction was good but the movie had an abrupt ending, and a few facts were not clearly explained.
