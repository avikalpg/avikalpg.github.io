	<h2>A guide to planning your decision making</h2>

		So today was an exceptional day for me, both at and after work.
		At work, we had our sprint retrospective meeting, in which we discussed the effect of certain goal-setting processes that our company was planning on the culture of the tech team.
		Outside of work, in my general mentorship call, one of my mentees, Vivek Singh, was talking about hacking his ability to receive rejection and abuse.
		Where we discussed a two-pronged process. 
		First, analyse, and interrogate anything that you do not understand.
		Second, if there is nothing new any step in the above process, stopping give any more importance to the situation.
		Another thing that happened, which was the most interesting, and the inspiration to this blog, is an article shared by one of my colleagues, Anuj Jain, regarding <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886921006978">"The Role of Metacognition in explaining decision-making styles"</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		This was a really interesting read for me, because this was the first time I was introduced to the concept of meta-cognition.
		So the paper defines metacognition as "the higher-order cognitive skills that help people monitor and control their information processing".
		Two components of metacognition have been widely recognised:
		<dl>
			<dt><b>Knowledge about cognition</b></dt>
			<dd>What people know about their cognition, cognition in general, strategies they use and conditions in which these strategies work the best.</dd>
			<dt><b>Recognition of cognition</b></dt>
			<dd>Specific sub-processes, namely, planning, monitoring, evaluation, information management strategies and debugging, which aid in controlling cognitive activities.</dd>
		</dl>
		Further, the paper explored the correlation of these components of metacognition with different styles of decision making.
		And to be able to understand these styles of decision making, I had to read up some more.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now, I didn't want to read another research paper to understand the different decision-making styles (but I would have if I had to).
		Thankfully, <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/decision-making-styles-2/#:~:text=%20Decision%20Making%20Styles%20%201%20Directive%20Style.,interested%20in%20making%20sure%20that%20everyone...%20More%20">this blog by Udemy</a> exists, which very cleanly summarizes the different types of decision making.
		I urge you to read the blog itself - it explains these concepts really well.
		Although, I will anyway provide the high-level categorization of the decision making styles here as well, along with my own super-short descriptions of the same.
		<i>Please do not rely on these definitions. Read the original article, which is barely a 10-minute read and very well structured.</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		So there are four main styles of decision making:
		<dl>
			<dt><b>Directive Style</b></dt>
			<dd>Basically the style of a dictator: quick and effective, but not inclusive and often short-sighted.</dd>
			<dt><b>Analytic Style</b></dt>
			<dd>A very data-based approach: it easily adapts to unique situations, but it is slow and is not very innovative as risky approaches are usually avoided</dd>
			<dt><b>Conceptual Style</b></dt>
			<dd>Artistic approach: Creative, achievement-oriented decision making which is taken with a long term vision, but oftentimes, very risky.</dd>
			<dt><b>Behavioural Style</b></dt>
			<dd>People-pleaser: The objective of this person is just to keep everyone happy and avoid conflict. And they love working in groups.</dd>
		</dl>
		The paper tries to categorize people into one of these four categories, but in one of the questionnaires, which tries to sort people into these groups, I saw some contextual questions as well.
		By contextual questions, I mean questions that try to capture the emotions and orientation of the person based on recent events.
		So I believe that the decision-making style of a person can change based on their experiences and environments.
		And introspection and self-observation can definitely help you in understanding the type of decision-maker you currently are, and ideally want to be.
		I believe that you must do this exercise for your own benefit.
	</p>
	<p>
		But even more interestingly, the blog also mentions "Group decision making styles". 
		I think this is more interesting because depending on the group that you are a part of, having an understanding of these different types of decision-making styles can come in handy.
		If you remember these group decision making styles, you will be better equipped to analyse the kind of group you are working with, and use a style that would work best in a given situation!
		And if this is going to be your group for an extended period of time, and if you have a preference among the different group decision making styles, you can make everyone in your group aware of these styles and try to mould the group behaviour so that it suits your favourite decision-making style.
		Okay, the last statement might be controversial, but I will go ahead and describe the different types of group decision making styles below, and you can let me know based on that, whether you agree with me or not.
		<dl>
			<dt><b>Autocratic</b></dt>
			<dd>The leader takes complete control and responsibility for the outcomes of the decision, without taking any suggestions or ideas from the team. It is fast, so it is effective in emergency situations. But it can result in resentment and low morale in many situations.</dd>
			<dt><b>Democratic</b></dt>
			<dd>The leader gives up ownership and control of the decision and allows the group to vote. This can result in a lack of individual responsibility, and hence, less optimal execution on the decision. And since consensus is not a requirement, opposers of a decision with undesirable outcomes might not feel responsible.</dd>
			<dt><b>Collective</b></dt>
			<dd>The leader will involve the members of the organization in all aspects of the decision-making process, but makes the final decision alone. This brings light to other perspectives on the situation although the leader maintains complete control of the final decision.</dd>
			<dt><b>Consensus</b></dt>
			<dd>The leader gives up complete control of the decision, while the whole group is completely involved and invested in the decision. Everyone must agree on the decision, and if there is no consensus, this style basically resolves to the democratic style of group decision-making. This style fosters a strong group commitment, and hence, has a high probability of success. It is, however, a very slow process and it can be difficult for a group to learn to work together in this manner. This is a useful decision-making style for a group that will be together for a long period of time such that the members can develop a strong, long term, professional relationship.</dd>
		</dl>
	</p>
	<p>
		From a first reading, I can already recognise the type of group decision making styles that I would like to apply in different situations.
		For example, it is obvious to go for the autocratic style in times of emergency.
		Whereas, when working as a part of the founding team, or as part of the board of directors for a company, the consensus style might be the best way forward.
		When leading an execution team, the collective style resonates with me the most.
		And I would use the democratic style only when I have no idea and opinion regarding the situation, and the stakes of the decision are not high enough for me to invest myself into gaining the required knowledge.
	</p>
	<p>
		What do you think? How would you use these different decision-making styles?
		Do you see any caveats in the methodology that I have proposed?
		I understand that I might have missed out on a tonne of different situations in my assessment. And I would love to know your perspective on them.
