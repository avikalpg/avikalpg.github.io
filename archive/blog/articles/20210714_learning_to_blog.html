	<h2>Learning to blog</h2>
	<small id="publishDate"><!-- Autofilled from meta --></small>
	<p>
		It has been more than 16 years since I learnt to write HTML,
		more than 8 years since I learnt computer programming,
		more than 4 years since I moved this homepage from the internal IIT Kanpur portal to Github.io,
		more than 2 years since I have had the urge to write a blog,
		and about 1 year since I created the `blog` section in this homepage.
		But it was not until this month that I finally started writing.
		And it is all thanks to the <a href="https://summertraining.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">#dgplug</a> summer training program.
	</p>
	<p>
		I had many misconceptions about blogging.
		To start off, I thought blogging was for contributing to the knowledge of the world in a new and unique manner.
		Then, I thought of blogging as a source of passive income, and hence classified it as useless unless I could earn through it.
		Thirdly, I thought blogs need to be top quality literature.
		And lastly, I thought that creating methods of interaction was key to running a blog.
	</p>
	<p>
		So what finally helped me start writing was <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/05/24/blog-about-what-you-ve-struggled-with/">this article</a> shared in the IRC channel of #dgplug.
		It says: blog what you have struggled with.
		I wouldn't say that this is the theme that I followed with the first few blogs.
		But it helped me write those because it broke so many of my myths about blogging.
	</p>
	<p>
		The second most helpful thing that happened was a conversation on the IRC channel itself.
		I reached out to the community to ask for smart and cheap ways of integrating "likes" and "comments" like features in my blog, which was hosted as a static website.
		I was planning to use AJAX calls to a backend API and having a database to save all the interactions.
		And to me, it was important to get feedback about my writing because I thought that was the only way to improve.
		In this conversation, a simple statement helped me come to a clear conclusion:
		<blockquote>
			Creating interactions on your blog either creates privacy issues for your readers, or security threats to your blog, or both.
		</blockquote>
		Additionally, I was suggested that posting a link to the article on Twitter, Reddit or even the IRC channel itself would be enough for me to get constructive feedback for my blog.
		So my path was clear: no user interactions on my blog please.
	</p>
	<p>
		I had started writing and it felt good. I have <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/99442664-avikalp-gupta?ref=nav_mybooks&shelf=read">read books about Habit formation</a>.
		So I also re-imagined the meaning of blogging from the full-form which I always knew: Web-Log.
		I understood that my blog just needs to be a log of things that go in my head.
		I just need to use it almost like a diary. 
		Writing whatever I feel like writing.
	</p>
	<p>
		Right then, came the icing on the cake. Robin Schubert took a session on blogging.
		This class was conducted today, over the same #dgplug IRC channel and it drove the point home for me.
		Here are a few resources which were shared in this session:
		<ol>
			<li><a href="https://summertraining.readthedocs.io/en/latest/blogging.html">Summer training doc on blogging</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://janusworx.com/blog/thoughts-on-setting-up-a-blog/">Thoughts on setting up a blog</a></li>
		</ol>
		Along with it, we learnt about RSS feeds and how blogs can be subscribed to using them.
		We learnt about the <a href="http://planet.dgplug.org/">#dgplug planet</a>.
		And now it all seemed to make perfect sense to me.
	</p>
	<p>
		After the class was over, one of the veterans of the channel shared the blogging story of his wife.
		His wife started learning computer science after her marriage and documented everything she learnt in a Tamil blog.
		And soon her blog grew to cover many concepts. 
		She continued writing them because it helped her understand those concepts better, but soon a compilation of her blogs took the shape of a book, which was shared on <a href="https://freetamilebooks.com/authors/nithyaduraisamy/">Free Tamil Books website</a>.
		Now she is a huge influence as she has created a great free repository for learning programming for Tamil readers.
		This story was inspirational for me. 
		I hope that I properly inculcate the habit of writing on this blog.
		I will be consistent, writing at least twice a week.
	</p>
	<p>
	I also have rekindled inspiration for writing such blogs in Hindi, which is my mother tongue. Maybe I will do that using the solutions I myself described in <a href="proj_hindi_keyboard.html">this blog</a>.
	</p>
	<p>Happy living, reading and writing!</p>
