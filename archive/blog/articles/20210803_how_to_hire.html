	<h2>Finding the right hire, the right way!</h2>
	<small id="publishDate"><!-- Autofilled from meta --></small>
	<p>
		I entered college in 2012, and since then, almost every year, I have been part of some recruitment process. Be it as a member of a club, part of a team, intern in a company or a full-time position.
		For over 9 years, I have been experiencing passing all the filtering processes, appearing for interviews, getting rejected and selected.
		In addition to that, for a long time, I have also been experiencing the story from the other side of the table.
		Finding, shortlisting, filtering, interviewing and selecting candidates on behalf of companies for multiple years now.
	</p>
	<p>
		For a long time in college, when a lot of filtering of candidates was done on the basis of the GPA, I used to wonder what is the importance of the GPA for the job?
		Why does the company care about my GPA if I am better than the 9 pointer at the job?
		At that time, I used to highly regard the interviews.
		I used to think that all evaluation must be done on the basis of the interview itself, in which the recruiter must check if the candidate has the knowledge and skills required to succeed at the job.
	</p>
	<p>
		As I became more mature and started interviewing candidates, I quickly realized that it is not possible to interview everyone.
		Some screening, shortlisting or preference ordering needs to be defined in order to get a good enough hire while spending the minimum possible time in hiring.
		But staying loyal to be opinion that the GPA is meaningless, I started looking at other things mentioned in a candidate's resume.
		The top things that I concentrated on were previous experience, projects, well-roundedness and public profiles like Github, LinkedIn etc.
	</p>
	<p>
		This worked out pretty well. Especially the evaluation based on projects.
		I observed that there is barely any correlation between the online courses the candidates does, and their proficiency in that topic.
		I also observed that irrespective of whether the candidate has had any formal training in any subject, if they have built a project using that, they get a strong grasp on that subject.
		But there is a caveat here, not all projects are equal.
	</p>
	<p>
		Project done just to showcase code, which are usually very small targeted projects, are generally less relevant.
		Projects which are built to solve a particular problem, in turn, are strong indications of a good candidate.
		This might probably be a result of secondary research that the candidate performs in order to find the easiest way of achieving the intended results.
		Compounded by the fact that the desired output of the project is defined by the environment and not based on how easy is it achieve.
	</p>
	<p>
		So these are all good enough to shortlist some candidates from the overall pool of all candidates.
		There is still the step to choose among the candidates who have been shortlisted.
		As is the norm, I started with testing the candidates on knowledge.
		I used to ask them technical questions and try to judge if they are good enough to succeed in the role they are getting hired for.
		But I realized it very soon that this is not the right way to approach things.
	</p>
	<p>
		The main drawback of doing this was that there is no set of right questions.
		Any set of questions would either be too narrow, that it would reject most good candidates as well.
		Or it would be too shallow to distinguish good candidates from the not-so-good ones.
	</p>
	<p>
		Hence, I found a different method of conducting the technical rounds.
		This new method was basically based on my interview experience with Microsoft Research.
		There, I was asked to present one of my projects, which was basically by semester long UG project.
		And the audience included everyone who was scheduled to interview me during that day.
		For many of those interviews, this project, and the various facets that any project has, was the basis for half or more of the conversation.
		And even if on paper, I was only an average candidate, due to my exceptional understanding of everything that entails the project I worked on, I was selected.
		Be it the motivation, problem setup, related work, all the different algorithms that were used, the underlying mathematics of those algorithms and why were they apt for the problem, the results, the next steps or the technology stack that we used and its pros and cons.
		I remember that one of the interviews got extended because the interviewer and I started discussing about all the programming languages and the obsessions and complaints we had about each of them.
	</p>
	<p>
		Based on this experience, I started talking to the candidate about any one of their projects in great depth.
		If possible, I would try to persuade the candidate to choose the project that he/she wants to talk about.
		My interview would fundamentally try to analyse how well does the candidate understands the intricacies of his/her own best project.
		This worked pretty well.
		And for the positions in the software consultancy that I worked for, this worked great.
		It was able to quickly filter out candidates who don't know what they are talking about.
	</p>
	<p>
		At this moment, I thought that I had figured out the right way to find good candidates.
		But the thing with interviews is that they are performances.
		Someoone who hasn't really done the work but can explain everything that was done can still perform very well at these interviews.
		There is no way to assess if the candidates who are selected in this process will actually perform well at the job.
		Obviously, taking coding tests during the interviews is a widespread practice; but that is simply a waste of the interviewer's time.
		One can much easily just use a platform like <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">HackerRank</a> to do the same.
	</p>
	<p>
		Then there was a suggestion for a take-home assignment - which seemed to be a good idea.
		It does not waste anybody's time and it also tests whether the candidate is able to get work done or not.
		But setting up a problem to be given for the assignment is hard. 
		One of my seniors gave me a tip to give one of my current tasks as a take home assignment.
		That was still a problem for me, as I need to formulate the problem much more formally for giving it as an interview assignment.
		And since I am a data scientist, it was even tougher, as now I need to spend time finding the right subset of data and preparing it well - anonymizing it and cleaning it.
		But this is all necessary evil. And its not the actual problem with such assignments.
	</p>
	<p>
		I understood the problem with such assignments when I started getting interviewed again.
		It distinctly remember that I was the interview assignment of a startup called <a href="https://www.docsapp.in/">DocsApp</a>.
		I was very excited to work with them as they were solving problems that were interesting for me and in a domain that I myself was very passionate about.
		All the stars seemed to align until the assignment was given to me.
		I was told that I should be to finish the assignment in 1 hours, but that was not an assignment that could be done by even a company in one hour.
		After having spent 3+ hours on the assignment, I ended up proposing the next steps and mentioning "if you want me do more than this, you will need to pay me for it" in the email.
		Basically, it is not hard for assignments to become exploitative.
		And this is commonly observed and reported as well.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the company I currently work in, which is <a href="https://getmega.com/">GetMega</a> - a mobile gaming platform,
		we approach hiring very differently.
		We do not even have a technical interview with the candidate at all. 
		The philosophy behind this decision is: we are doing novel things all the time, so it is not possible for anyone to know everything that they will need to do their job.
	</p>
	<p>
		Here is the hiring process for the engineering team that we follow:
		<ol>
			<li><b>Cultural round</b>: the objective of this round is to assess if there is cultural fit and goal alignment between the candidate and the company. If you want to retain your employees, you want to be sure that their personal success is tied to the success of the company.</li>
			<li><b>Take-home assignment</b>: we give a hard problem, with a unique setting, which requires innovative thinking. We also tell the candidate that it would require around 4-5 hours of concentrated effort to finish. This is supposed to be an emulation of general work that one would do. So we would expect the candidate to learn what is required, and deliver the highest quality outcome possible.</li>
			<li><b>Full loop interview</b>: this is a simulation of a high stress work day at the company. In this interview, the canidate needs to take a day off from their current work and work with us on a set problem, treating us as teammates. There is a hard deadline of 5 PM, when a mock presentation is scheduled. This round is one that finally answers the question: Do you want to work with this candidate?</li>
			<li><b>Founder's round</b>: This is mostly just a formality. It is conducted so that the founders know every person who is working for the company - this creates a sense of belonging for the employee. And it also encompasses salary negotiations etc.</li>
		</ol>
		We have a habit of asking all of our candidates about their experience with the interview process that we follow.
		Without exception, every single candidate says that they have never seen this before.
		And till now, every candidate has nothing but good things to say about the process.
	</p>
	<p>
		Their emotional states are almost always we expect it to be.
		We communicate that effectively, which makes the candidates feel even better about it.
		In fact, one such conversation has triggered me to write this blog.
		We actually treat our candidates with respect, and properly evaluate their submissions.
		I had just submitted the review of one of the assignments, and had previously shared my phone number with the candidate so that they can ask me any doubts they might have regarding the assignment.
		After the doubt clarification, I asked if he was enjoying working on the project, or if it was a pain.
		The review to the assignment was quite brutal, and hence I didn't expect a very positive answer.
		But to my pleasant surprise, the candidate was very excited to deliver on the assignment.
		To quote him, "I would work on this assignment even if I am already rejected for the position. I would keep on reiterating on it until I deliver a good submission. I find it very interesting and I am learning a lot by working on it."
		This statement provided me validation regarding our approach to the assignments, as well as increased the chances of his selection. :P
	</p>
	<p>
		The full-loop, however efficient, still takes up a lot of time from the actual employees of the company.
		We recently came across the concept of Audition projects.
		Audition projects seem to be the perfect candidate for establishing that a candidate would be perfect to work with.
		It actually tests the candidate on what really matters - actually working in the company.
		It also pays the candidate for the work that they do for the company - so there is no exploitation as well.
		Inspired by this, I am trying to curate my own mentorship platform project, <a href="https://alokit.in/">Alokit Innovations</a> to serve companies who want to engage with prospective candidates through audition projects.
	</p>
	<p>
		The problem of hiring is still far from solved.
		But I believe I can find a solution to it in the near future, and not just for myself, but for every company working in the domains of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
