	<h2>Explaining reproduction and rainfall to children</h2>
	<small id="publishDate"></small>
	<p>
		Explaining child birth correctly involves an explanantion of the reproductive process in Humans (or generally, sexual reproduction in all species who do so).
		Doing so would require parents, or any adult for that matter, to talk about the reproductive organs in the body, which can get awkward.
		But is it morally correct or not?
	</p>
	<p>
		Yesterday, I, an atheist Hindu, and my father, a theist Hindu, were having a discussion about the existence of God and religion in the Hindu (south Asian) culture.
		I argued that Hindus (whatever that means), especially the ones following the "Sanatana Dharma", never believed in the existence of an Almighty, until they were ruled by foreigners who believed so.
		And my father argued that masses cannot understand the complex constructs that I am talking about and that a culture with a belief in a almighty is required for masses to follow it.
	</p>
	<p>
		During this discussion, he brought up a really interesting point. He asked me what would I tell my children when they ask about rainfall and child birth?
		When I started to tell that I would tell them the truth, he responded with how much truth?
		And that the child would never stop asking questions unless there is a strong answer, like "The Almighty does it by will", which invites no further questions.
		He said that it is much wiser to answer with "There is a giant elephant who showers the water in the form of rain" or "children are gifts given to couples when they have been good as children".
		He argued that it is important to appease the curiosity of the child, otherwise you would never get anything done, and the child might go mad in search of answers.
	</p>
	<p>
		Apparently, my thoughts are the polar opposites of those. I felt that it is a great boon to have undying curiosity.
		The world is a complex place, and we, as the humanity, do understand a lot of it.
		So why misguide our children into thinking that things are a certain way while they actually aren't.
		The way physics works is beyond what we can decipher even scientifically.
		So why waste the time of the young humans in learning a baseless explanation of natural activities, then unlearn them and learn the most updated scientific explanations of those?
		Don't we want them to be able to figure out where the knowledge gap is and try to figure out what an even better explanation would be?
	</p>
	<p>
		My plan to deal with such questions with my children is to tell them the most updated scientific truth.
		They might get too knowledgeable about reproductive organs much sooner than all their peer, and that might lead to some awkward and downright embarrassing situations.
		But I think that is a smaller price to pay compared to the volume of maturity that it will bring to my children.
		We live in the information age.
		As soon as they learn to read and write, I will expose them to Wikipedia.
		I will nurture a more scientific way of living in them, while abiding by all the formailities, rituals and customs of our traditional Hindu culture.
