	<h2>Why Gifts are a thing?</h2>
	<small id="publishDate"><!-- Autofilled from meta --></small>
	<p>
		One of the big changes that I will be going through in my life very soon is marriage.
		I am scheduled to be married on November 20 this year.
		And since I belong to a Hindu family, we'd be having a traditional Hindu wedding.
		Also known as the big fat Indian wedding.
		And it involves a lot of gifts. 
		Gifts that are a ritual now, so much so that if someone does not give a gift as prescribed, people frown on them.
	</p>
	<p>
		In all this turmoil, where my parents are trying to figure out the right gifts for the right relatives,
		I felt really sad because I have never understood why gifts work. 
		And this lack of understanding has led to less gifting and less happiness on receiving gifts.
		I have to schedule gifting on my calender 3 days before the birthday of everyone that is important to me.
		And yet, it is a stressful activity to think of a good gift and then get it delivered.
	</p>
	<p>
		Moreover, the kind of gifts that I have ever found to be good enough are either things that I know that 
		they want or they need, or things that requires time and effort investment from the gifter (instead of just buying something).
		Hence, I end up learning songs, drawing portraits or cartoons, writing poems etc. in the name of gifts.
		Some people feel really special because of it, but some other people, who I am since not very close to, have found it uninspiring.
	</p>
	<p>
		Many times, I have wondered, why gifting is a thing.
		As so many other emotions can be explained by survival critical instincts of the early human beings,
		I want to know an explanation of gifts as well.
		There were two things that did lead to some sort of understanding. But I cannot be very confident about either.
	</p>
	<p>
		First was the need to collect stuff. Humans have evolved from being gatherers.
		People who gathered, survived, and who didn't, did not.
		This gathering can be related to essentials like food and water, but also related to non-functional items like twigs, stones and metal.
		Twigs, stones and metals could be used to deal with predators.
		And alternatively, they could also be used for decoration. Aesthetics have always been something that has elevated the human spirit.
		So the same instinct of gathering might have lead to positive associations with acquiring by force, stealth or gifts.
	</p>
	<p>
		This felt alright, but does really specifically explain gifts.
		Gathering does not directly relate to getting something from another human.
	</p>
	<p>
		My mother gave this argument which really struck with me as well.
		She said that community living has been essential for human survival.
		And in community living, not everyone gathers equally.
		For survival, the more efficient gatherers would gift their gatherings to other members of the group as well.
		Especially the ones who might not be able to gather enough to survive.
		Hence, getting those gifts might have become a means of survival for them.
	</p>
	<p>
		To me, this also partly explains why there are different types of individuals.
		Ones, who like getting the gifts, and the others who don't enjoy it as much. Like me.
		This might have developed from the positioning of a person in their group.
		The leaders, the more efficient gatherers, might not develop a need to get gifts. 
		So, for such people, gifts do not trigger the same instincts.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another, more controversial observation that follows this is that women are more likely to like receiving gifts.
		During the course of evolution, even until the uprise of modern medicine in the last century,
		the role of the woman has been to get pregnant and produce kids.
		In that condition, gathering would become a very tedious activity, and they would depend on the other members of the group for their survival.
		Especially their male counterparts.
		Hence, getting the gatherings of their male partners as gifts would become key to their survival.
	</p>
	<p>
		All of these are just thoughts and speculations based on my own introspection and discussions. Do reach out to me on email if you have a better explanation of why gifting and receiving gifts is an activity in humans which triggers positive emotions.
		The first explanation above relates to the release of dopamine and the second explanantion relates to the release of oxytocin.
