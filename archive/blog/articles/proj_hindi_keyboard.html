	<h2>Hindi Education and Devnagari Keyboard</h2>
	<small id="publishDate"></small>
	<h3>The Status Quo</h3>
	<p>
		Currently, at least in the urban India, all digital publication, including tweets, chats, blogs, books etc., seem to be driven by English education written in the latin script (which is the default script of English).
		In the past couple of decades, there has been a gargantuan shift in the use of language in communication.
		People have been using their mother tongues, writing it in the latin script, to communicate with other people who speak the same language.
		But latin script is not the default for any of the Indian languages. And often, it does not work optimally.
	</p>
	<p>
		As a result, for communication, new products have come out, like the Indic keyboard offered by Google on Android phones.
		Note that, traditional Devnagari (or any other Indic script) keybaords did not draw the usage of the Hindi speaking language.
		People continued to use the latin keyboard to communicate in their own languages.
		From this we can clearly understand the difference between the affinity of the people to their language compared to the default script of their langauge.
	</p>
	<p>
		Without loss of generality, I will write the rest of this article from the perspective of the Hindi language and the Devnagari script.
		One can translate all of these concepts to any other Indian language and their corresponding script.
	</p>
	<p>
		So we know that Hindi speakers do not mind writing in the latin script instead of the devnagari script, in fact, prefer that, because they are familiar with the keyboard.
		This is because the people who are using these keyboards are not new to keyboards. They have been using English for their work or something else. And they have now started using the keyboard for communication.
	</p>
	<p>
		So it seems that the problem is solved. But it is not. Official documents, like scientific publications and books would not look appealing if they aren't written in the default script of a language. That is why you don't see many popular books written with a non-default script.
	   And the Google Indic keyboard really only works on touch based interfaces. I haven't yet seen any way to write in that manner on a computer. 
	   So the Google Indic keyboard solution should be made translatable to laptop and desktop keyboards, or we need a trend of local people learning to touch-type in keyboards specifically crafted for Devnagari script.
	   In any case, we want to make it natural to be able to type on computer keyboards in the natural script of the native languages of everyone.
	</p>
	<p>
		Additionally, we also need to be make all the existing knowledge available to Hindi speakers. All the knowledge that is English-encoded in countless books and research publications. In fact, why just English, there is a lot of knowledge encoded in Russian, German, Japanese and Mandarin as well.
		For us to be able to make the best use of every mind, we need to make existing knowledge available to every one through the world.
		And this availability is not limited to accessibility of the documents themselves, but the means to decode them as well.
		We need a lot more than a good translation machine to solve that problem as well.
		But the good news is, we are not solving this problem for the first time. We have solved it many times before. We just need to put the effort into making it happen again in this context.
	</p>

	<h3>Actions required</h3>
	<p>
		There has been considerable progress on multiple of these things, that am about to mention.
		But the aim is not to tell you want is it that you should start working on immediately.
		Choose what you like and search for existing work in the domain. Build on top of it; don't reinvent the wheel.
		Unless, of course, the wheel was built with proprietary ownership, and not publically owned.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are two broad things that need to be done to accomplish this. And I will explore them in the following sections.
	</p>
	
	<h4>Transliteration Route</h4>
	<p>
		Just to bring you up to speed, here is the definition of the term `Transliteration` as provided by Wikipedia:
		<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transliteration">Transliteration is a type of conversion of a text from one script to another that involves swapping letters in predictable ways.</blockquote>
		So when the Google Indic Keyboard turns your latin script Hindi words to Devnagari script Hindi words, what it is doing is essentially transliteration. Although, for Indic languages, it is not so straight forward.
		So Google has to apply smart learning models to be able to do that skillfully, and even so, it makes mistakes.
		And a lot of times, what it makes are not really mistakes per se, equivalent transliterations which does not exactly suit what the writr was aiming for.
	</p>
	<p>
		There is not a lot of work in this route.
		We continue to use the same keyboards as we do now.
		We install the smart transliteration service in our desktops.
		And <i>voila!</i>, you have a working computer for typing Hindi books and literature in Devnagari.
	</p>
	<p>
		Unfortunately, this does not really solve the problem. This is because for the Google Indic Keyboard method to work, the user needs to be aware of the English alphabet, and touch-typing trained for using the keyboard for writing in the latin script.
		So this solution will only work for existing typists to be able to start typing in other scripts as well.
		It does not solve the accessibility issue from the core.
	</p>

	<h4>End-to-end Route</h4>
	<p>
		This is the really tideous route
		It requires a lot of work starting from choosing the right design for a Devnagri keyboard. Creating custom Devnagri keybaords and testing them with small user bases.
		Then the main task of taking it to the target populations - the Hindi speaking people in the rural India, for whom, this technology will be life-altering in terms of career opportunities.
		At this point, various efforts will have to be made in order to make touch-typing in Devnagri a lucrative, yet viable skill to learn.
		This can include setting up training centers, but also creating typing tutor programs, which can be used to popularise touch typing in Devnagri.
		Once an optimal experience has been designed with a few such populations, a marketing and growth strategy can be executed.
	</p>
	<p>
		Among the myriad things that I have mentioned above, here are some of the projects I would love to contribute towards:
		<ul>
			<li>Prototyping the first custom Devnagri keyboards using open-sourced hardware</li>
			<li>Creating the touch-typing tutor application for Devnagri script, consisting of quotes from amazing Hindi literature, including books like Chanakya Neeti, Ramayana, Mahabharata, Bhagwad Gita and the novels of great writers like Munshi Premchand. It can also include movie screenwritings of the great Bollywood movies that have been created over the last 100 years.</li>

			<li>Conversion of quintessential books and academic journals and other publications from English to Hindi</li>
			<li>Marketing of these pieces of contents and market creation for Hindi literature in the Indian society</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		I am sure that a lot of people are working towards multiple of these projects.
		And I am more than happy about that.
		I would much rather prefer to build on what others have already started, than to start building from scratch. Although, I will not shy away from doing that if that must be done.
		I also believe that best way to develop a technology solution with such widespread possible impact, is through open-source. 
		Going through the profit making but open-source model should help in responsible and optimal development of the application, while encouraging enough investment into its marketing and publicity.
		I hope to be able to pick this project up with in the next couple of years.
		And hence, I am writing this blog to remind me of this project, when I am ready to pursue it.
