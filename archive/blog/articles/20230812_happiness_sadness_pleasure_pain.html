	<h2>Happiness : Sadness :: Pleasure : Pain?</h2>
	<small id="publishDate"><!-- Autofilled from meta --></small>
    <p>
        At <a href="https://vibinex.com">Vibinex</a>, we have amazing lunch discussions. Multiple employees and interns have mentioned that their highlight of the day was always the conversations over lunch, even when they are assigned super-interesting work.
        This week, one such conversation was initiated by my co-founder, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tapishr">Tapish Rathore</a>.
        He asked an open question: What is the ratio of happiness to sadness in a person's life?
        Do people stay sad more or do they stay happy more? What is this ratio a function of?
        Before you read ahead, I would urge you to think about this question yourself (and hopefully send me your response on any of my socials).
    </p>
    <p>
        So here is my answer:
        I think everyone has the exact same amount of happiness and sadness in their lives. 
        Why?
        Because humans only perceive differences.
        Our eyes don't sense light, they sense the difference between the light from the previous moment.
        Our ears, nose, skin, tongue, and all the other sense organs only ever measure the difference between their last state and their current state.
        And our perception of happiness and sadness is not an exception.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here, my definitions of happiness and sadness are that of being opposites of each other.
        They are on the same scale - a sort of projection of each emotion on the "happiness" scale.
        For example, emotions like elation, laughter, pride, ecstasy, achievement, contentment, satisfaction, bliss etc. have a component in the positive direction of happiness.
        And emotions such as grief, pain, disappointment, rage, anxiety, guilt, disgust etc. have a component in the negative direction of happiness.
        I am defining sadness here as the absence of happiness. 
        Like darkness is defined as the absence of light.
    </p>
    <p>
        I believe that if you plot this happiness value of a person's life over time, you can draw the lines for their average, median and mode happiness levels.
        And whenever a person is above this average line, they feel that they are generally experiencing a good time in their life.
        And when they are below the line, they feel that the times are not that good.
        But this line is very customized to the person.
    </p>
    <p>
        Consider two different people, Amar and Badri.
        Amar was born into an affluent family with a very loving and caring family.
        His parents have put a lot of effort into his upbringing and tried to make sure that he learns everything he needs to learn to succeed in life.
        And so he does.
        He excels in his studies and gets a job that he loves and that pays well.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the other hand, Badri is not so fortunate.
        He is born into a family that struggles financially. 
        During his childhood, his parents weren't around too much because they were both working multiple jobs to sustain their livelihood and provide him with good education and facilities.
        He did end up getting a job, but it is not the job of his choice and pays just enough for him to go on.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now it is clear that Amar's quality of life is much better than that of Badri.
        But does that directly translate into happiness?
        Does Amar always stay happy? Does Badri always remain sad? No.
        Amar gets upset about not getting that promotion that he worked so hard on.
        And Badri gets elated whenever he is able to buy anything for his parents.
        The high points in Badri might not feel high to Amar, and the low points in Amar's life might not feel low to Badri.
    </p>
    <p>
        A <a href="https://youtu.be/d-S3oubvCu0?t=103">scene</a> from the TV Show <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends">FRIENDS</a> (Season 4, Episode 22) explains this concept to a good extent in a very relatable manner.
        In this scene, Phoebe listens to a big problem that Rachel has regarding 'going to Ross &amp; Emily's wedding' and says that it reminds her of the time when she was offered food in exchange for sex when she lived on the streets.
        When asked how are these two things related, she said that they are not - because what she had was an actual problem while what Rachel has is just a bunch of high school crap that no one gives a shit about.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have watched the show, you know that Phoebe has a very tough life, while Rachel was a spoilt brat.
        What was a huge problem for Rachel didn't even qualify as a problem for Phoebe.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here we compared the experience of a life event for two different persons who have different average happiness levels.
        Another aspect of this is the variance. 
        When you have higher highs and lower lows, you tend to feel that your life is very happening.
        Whereas when your highs are not that high and lows are not that low, you tend to feel boredom.
        My philosophy is to try to live a life as happening as possible. To do things and feel things.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is where Tapish asked his next question:
    </p>
    <h4>Do you associate happiness with pleasure and sadness with pain?</h4>
    <p>
        For me, the answer is a clear no. Even if pleasure has a positive component to the happiness value and pain has a negative component towards it, these are not opposites.
        The absence of pleasure is not pain.
        In fact, for many kinds of pleasure, experiencing pain is a mandatory step.
    </p>
    <p>
        In our <a href="20230805_learning_in_entertainment.html">previous blog on entertainment</a>, we discussed pleasure hormones.
        One of those hormones, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endorphins">Endorphins</a> are only produced through physical pain (when you workout, play sports or achieve an orgasm). 
        But even more generally, pleasure and pain usually come together. You can only feel a sense of achievement if you have put a lot of hard work into something. Often going through a lot of pain.
        Without pain, there is hardly any pleasure. And you usually stay in a state of boredom (as defined above).
